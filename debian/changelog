dehydrated-hook-luadns (0.8.6-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Tidied up jq script calls for parsing json data received.

  * Changed the query for the zone records to directly query
    the zone records to simplify the process of obtaining the
    record ID.

  * Changed the number of retries to query for the record to 7
    from 5 to allow a wait time of up to 128 seconds between
    tries after deploying the challenge.

dehydrated-hook-luadns (0.8.5-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Made checks of API server responses more robust.

  * Zone ID is now checked that it is a valid number.

  * Creation of the Record is checked for the same content

    previously it was possible for this check to fail in
    certain circumstance.

  * Curl errors whould now be printed to allow easier debug of
    problems.

dehydrated-hook-luadns (0.8.2-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added a section in the manual to talk through the detailed 
    operation of the script at a low level.

  * Changed to "#!/usr/bin/env bash" from "#!/bin/bash" at top
    of script.

dehydrated-hook-luadns (0.8.1-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added a check for sed in the check dependencies section of the
    script. Also included sed in the list of dependencies in the
    man page.

  * Minor improvements to printouts.

dehydrated-hook-luadns (0.8.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed issue referred to below whereby the script would hang
    indefinitely if multiple Record IDs were found with the same
    name, type AND content.

  * This is an edge case that is probably impossible if used with
    dehydrated, but is possible to have happen if multiple
    deploy_challenge calls to the script are made with the same values
    before being followed by a clean_challenge call.

  * Now the script will delete all Records found for a given name, TXT
    type and the same content.

  * Man page formatting improvements.

dehydrated-hook-luadns (0.7.7-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added functionality to 1st query the luadns nameservers for the
    NS records for the zone name (root of the fqdn) passed in via
    dehydrated.

  * The script will exit if none of the luadns nameservers have any
    NS records for the domain passed in from dehydrated. This serves as
    a means to check the domain for validity.

  * The script will now check all of the official nameservers (usually
    ns1.luadns.net, ns2.luadns.net, ns3.luadns.net and ns4.luadns.net)
    obtained from the above check for the TXT record after deploying.
    Previously it would only check ns1.luadns.net.

  * The above functionality was added as it is possible to use vanity
    nameservers from Luadns.com with their paid plans. This way the script
    checks the real authorative nameserver after deploying the record.

  * Changed number of retries in the propagation check from 8 to 5.

  * Updates to man page to mention this new functionality.

  * Noting that there is an issue with the clean_challenge function that
    if there are 2 records with the same name, type AND content whereby
    the script will hang.

  * This is probably an edge case, but is intended to be fixed for the
    next version.

dehydrated-hook-luadns (0.7.2-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Moved the dig command to query the nameserver for the record
    being deployed into its own function to make things a bit tidier.

  * Added information to manual about creating an API key via the
    Luadns.com Web UI.

  * Other minor man page improvements.

dehydrated-hook-luadns (0.7.1-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Some minor improvements to the print outs of the function that
    queries the authortative nameserver (ns1.luadns.net) for the
    record deployed. It will now print Try 1/8, 2/8 etc.

dehydrated-hook-luadns (0.7.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Updated man pages to reflect change about awk as a depenency.

  * Updated man page to show how to test the script directly, and
    encouraged user to try it out before using it with dehydrated
    to issue real certificates.

  * Changed the function that waits for the record to be deployed to
    with for an exponentially increasing number of seconds each try.

  * Change the grep from "-qF" to "-qw". Might need to revisit this
    but it's working well for now.

dehydrated-hook-luadns (0.6.1-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Tidied up curl commands with a custom curl_cmd function.

  * Changed method of extracting the zone name to a simplier method
    using awk instead.

  * Added a check for awk being installed.

  * Streamlined deploy_challenge and clean_challenge print outs to
    be more consistant.

  * Removed the use of echo to pass the Zone ID or Record ID outside
    the relevant functions so exit works as expected.

  * Trimmed some of the comments from the main script.

  * Added dependencies for bash and coreutils.

dehydrated-hook-luadns (0.6.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added HOOK_CHAIN="yes" support for deploy_challenge and clean_challenge
    functions. Script will now support just a single call by dehydrated to
    deploy or clean multiple records/challenges at once.

  * Tidied up message printouts of the script.

  * Updated man page to mention HOOK_CHAIN="yes" is now supported.

  * Removed "set -e" to prevent script exiting with all non-zero return
    codes as this was undesirable behaviour. 

  * Long term would like to re-try API calls if they fail, instead
    of exiting right away.

dehydrated-hook-luadns (0.5-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Removed abort 1 exit function in favor of "set -e".

  * Changed method of handling input arguments to the exact same method
    posted in the dehydrated documentation here:
    https://github.com/dehydrated-io/dehydrated/blob/master/docs/examples/hook.sh

  * Changed reload of nginx to just print an error if not successful,
    instead of returning an error code so to not interfere with the
    operation of the master dehydrated script.

  * Added explicit "exit 0" to make sure script exits successfully.

  * Trimmed some of the comments from the main script.

 -- Mark Finnan <mfinnan101@gmail.com>  Wed, 07 May 2025 11:04:39 +0100

dehydrated-hook-luadns (0.3-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Added a deploy_cert function to automatically reload nginx if a new
    cert is issued. Requires export automatic_nginx_reload="yes" in the
    main dehydrated config.

  * Noting that long-term supporting HOOK_CHAIN="yes" is a better option
    to only have nginx reloaded once if multiple certificates are issued.

  * Currently nginx will be reloaded X times if X new certificates are
    are issued. With HOOK_CHAIN, that would just be once.

  * Also updated postinst script to include this in the print out after
    a new installation.
